This course is an interdisciplinary exploration of three broad topics concerning music in relation to time.

1.  Music as Architecture: the creation of musical shapes in time;
2.  Music as Memory: how musical understanding depends upon memory and reminiscence, with attention to analysis of musical structures; and
3.  Time as the Substance of Music: how different disciplines such as philosophy and neuroscience view the temporal dimension of musical processes and/or performances.

Classroom discussion of these topics is complemented by three weekend concerts with pre-concert forums, jointly presented by the [Boston Chamber Music Society](http://www.bostonchambermusic.org/) (BCMS) and MIT Music & Theater Arts.
